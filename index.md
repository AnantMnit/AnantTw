### About Me

![Anant Goyal](https://cdn.vectorstock.com/i/1000v/30/21/human-blank-face-with-eps10-vector-25623021.jpg)

Hi, I'm Anant Goyal, a Computer Science student at MNIT Jaipur. I'm passionate about technology, problem-solving, and coding. My journey in tech started with a curiosity for how things work, and since then, I’ve been exploring various aspects of computer science, particularly web development, machine learning, and software engineering. 

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me reading tech blogs, experimenting with new tools, or watching movies. I'm always eager to learn and grow in this fast-paced field.
